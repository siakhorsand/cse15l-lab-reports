- Here is an example of using *cd* with a path to an example *directory*:

`cd/Users/siakhorsand/cs11`

This command takes the terminal to the cs11 folder(*ls* and *pwd* are then used to check the contents of the folder/current directory).

- Here is an example of using *cd* with a direct path to a file:

`cd /Users/siakhorsand/Documents/Github/COGS108_Repo/README.md`

As you can see in the image below, *cd* does not work with a path to a file because it does not open files or show contents. However, it can navigate to the folder in which the file is in.
