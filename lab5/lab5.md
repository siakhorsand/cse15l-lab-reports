# Lab Report 5: Putting it All Together

**by Sia Khorsand**

## Part 1 â€“ Debugging Scenario

The scenario I will use in this lab report is similar to ones we have dealt with in the second half of this quarter, but are effective and essential to getting some practice with debugging.  

### Original Post

**Student Post:**

message: 
> I'm currently writing some tests for ListExamples. I'm using JUnit to write the tests, but I'm running into some issues.
> Here are my symptoms:
The testFilter method is failing with a runime error. The expected array is [apple, banana, avocado], but the actual result is [avocado].
The testMerge1 and testMerge2 methods are both timing out after 500 milliseconds. I'm guessing I did something wrong with the indexing of the filter method but I might be wrong.

>For the testMerge1 and testMerge2 failures, I guess there might be an issue with the merging logic causing an infinite loop which could lead to the runtime error.
>Please let me know what I can do to fix these issues!

Test bash script: 
```
#!/bin/bash

javac -cp .:junit-4.13.2.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar ListExamples.java ListExamplesTests.java
java -cp .:junit-4.13.2.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests > test_output.txt

if grep -q "FAILURES!!!" test_output.txt;
then
    echo "Some tests failed. Check test_output.txt for details."
else
    echo "All tests passed!"
fi
```
### TA Response

**TA Response:**
message: 
> Hi Sia,
> Let's start by looking at the filter method. You could maybe check what is assigned to `result` and trace your logic problem from there. You might want to look at the number before the comma, and whether it is necessary.
> For the merge method, you are right that the loops are running indefinitely. Maybe re-check the reassignments of index1 and index2 in your if/else statements and the conditions of the while loops.
> Let me know once you try.

> Best,

### Student Follow-Up

**Student Follow-Up:**

message: 
> Thanks for the pointers!
> I went back and reviewed the ContainsA implementation and realized that the checkString method was fine.
> But the issue was in how I was adding elements to the result list in the filter method.
> I was adding elements at the beginning (result.add(0, s)) instead of the end. I changed it to result.add(s), and that fixed the testFilter issue.

> For the testMerge1 and testMerge2 methods, you were right about the while loop.
>  I had an incorrect index update within the else block. 
> I fixed the index update to ensure it increments correctly, incrementing index2 instead of index1 in the else statements, and adding `+` before the `=` in the first else statement to correctly increment and fix the typo. Previoiusly, the else statement was simply reassigning 1 to index2 instead of incrementing it, and the second else statement incremented index1 instead of index2. 
> now the tests run within the time limit and produce the correct output. 


## Part 2 - Reflection

>Something I learned during the second half of the labs in this class was using the java debugger and jdb. I believe it was during lab 8 or 9 that we used jdb to track down exactly what are the symptoms and bugs in a certain java class/method. Especially while studying for the 4th skill demo, I got practice with stopping the compute at a certain line and checking the values of different local variables at that point in the code. I can imagine that this method is extremely useful in terms of finding and fixing bugs in real professional settings in the tech industry. All in all, although my schedule was packed this quarter and I wasn't able to keep up as fast and as well as I would have hoped, I thoroughly enjoyed this class and the skills I gained from it, specifically the practice I got with debugging java files and getting comfortable with the different tools and packages in the terminal. These are skills that I will definitely practice on my own and apply in my journey with computer science.
